    Exponentiation **
    Unary plus and minus +x, -x
    Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Floor division *, /, %, //
    Addition and Subtraction +, -

13)Using steps in slices-
    Adding a step value to a slice to skip characters eg s[0:5:2]

14)String operators (like concatenation)-
    Operators like + to concatenate (join) strings and * to repeat strings.

15)Inserting values into strings-

17)Using blocks and statements

18)Writing basic if conditions-
    An if condition lets you run code only when a certain condition is true. If the condition is true, the code inside the if block runs.

19)elif for multiple conditions-
    elif is used when you want to check multiple conditions after the if statement. If the first if condition is false, Python moves to the elif to check another condition.

20)Using condition operators-
    Learning comparison operators like ==, !=, >, <, etc., to compare values in conditional statements.

21)Combining conditions with and, or-
    Using logical operators like and and or to combine multiple conditions in an if statement.

    sing the in operator to check if a value exists within a sequence like a string or list

24)Writing for loops-
    Using for loops to iterate over sequences like lists or strings and perform repeated actions.

25)Loops inside other loops-
    Creating nested loops, where one loop runs inside another, for tasks like iterating through a grid or matrix.

26)continue and break in loops-
    Using continue to skip the rest of the current loop iteration or break to exit the loop entirely.

27)Repeating tasks with while loop-
    Using a while loop to repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains true.

28)Breaking out of while loops-
    Exiting a while loop before the condition becomes false using the break statement to prevent infinite loops.

3)Basics of Function- 
    A function has a name, optional inputs (parameters), and a body with code that runs when the function is called.

4)Logic of Functions- 
    Functions follow specific steps. They can have if statements, loops, and more to decide what to do based on inputs.

5)Tuple Unpacking- 
    When a function returns multiple values in a tuple, you can split them into variables in one step, like x, y = my_function().

     When a function or code block is inside another function, it’s called "nested." Scope defines where variables are accessible. Variables created inside a function can only be used there, while those outside are accessible everywhere in the code.

2)Interactions between Python Functions-
    Functions can call each other, share data, or use each other’s results. This interaction helps break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable functions.                                  

3)Tasks Completed-

1. Collections Module: 
    Provides specialized data structures like `Counter` (counts items), `defaultdict` (auto-defaults missing values), and `namedtuple` (simple object-like tuples) for efficient data handling.

2. OS Module: 
    Offers tools to interact with the operating system. Lists files, reads/writes files, and handles directories, making it essential for file management in Python.

3. Datetime Module: 
    Manages dates and times. You can get current dates, manipulate time (add days or hours), and convert date strings into Python datetime objects.

4. Math and Random Modules: 
    `math` offers functions for mathematical operations like square roots and factorials. `random` enables random number generation, selections, and more.

5. Python Debugger: 
    `breakpoint()` lets you pause and inspect code during execution. It’s useful for checking variable values and understanding program flow interactively.

6. Regular Expressions Part One: 
    `re.search` finds specific patterns in text. Useful for locating strings or substrings by matching them to predefined patterns.
